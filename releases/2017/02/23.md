Before we start:


After we're done:

Admin to add deprecation message:

    The message can be set by admins in /en-US/admin/models/zadmin/config/, by adding a Config with the submit_notification_warning key and the desired text as value (HTML is allowed)

    ** HTML START **
    Starting with Firefox 53, new add-ons that use legacy APIs (anything except <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions">WebExtensions</a>) will not be accepted on AMO. Version updates using legacy APIs will continue to be accepted at least until Firefox 57. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/16/the-road-to-firefox-57-compatibility-milestones/">Read more on the upcoming compatibility milestones.</a>
    ** HTML END **
    ^ Does that mean a particular date or when Firefox 53 hits a certain release date (Beta or Release). Would something like "Starting on April 20th (when Firefox 53 goes to release)..." be clearer? Also link to the blog post?

        The upload restriction is tied to the compatibility of the add-on, so it's not really dependent on a date. I don't think we have a set milestone for when we will turn that on.

    Latest edit is now on -dev and stage. Let me know if further changes are required. (stuart). [DONE]
