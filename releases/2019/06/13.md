## Notable things shipping:

## Cherry-picks:

Link to the actual commits, NOT merge commits. The commits need to appear
in chronological order so that `git cherry-pick` will apply them correctly.

## Pushing:

- https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/compare/2019.06.06-1...2019.06.13

## Before we push:

* Please push the redirects described at https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/issues/8123 to prod, as the rules for these which are currently enforced in frontend code are being removed with this push, and we therefore need the nginx rules in place.
