Link to the actual commits, NOT merge commits. The commits need to appear
in chronological order so that `git cherry-pick` will apply them correctly.

## Before we push:

* Please push the redirects described at https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/issues/8123 to prod, as the rules for these which are currently enforced in frontend code are being removed with this push, and we therefore need the nginx rules in place. Note that these rules were updated according to https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/issues/8163 as well, but I think this still involves pushing just one set of rules.
