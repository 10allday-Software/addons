# AMO Release Thursday 9th May 2019

This week's push hero is [kumar](https://github.com/kumar303)

## Notable things shipping:

This push will contain **two weeks worth of commits** as the 2019-05-02 push was skipped due to public holidays in Europe.

## Blockers:

*

## Cherry-picks:

Link to the actual commits, NOT merge commits. The commits need to appear
in chronological order so that `git cherry-pick` will apply them correctly.
