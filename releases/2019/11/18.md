## Pushing

- https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/compare/2019.11.14...2019.11.18

:warning: I could not find `2019.11.14-1` locally (for weird git reasons), so I created `2019.11.18` based on `2019.11.14`, which is why we have two commits instead of one. The first commit was cherry-picked in `2019.11.14-1` (see [this push doc](https://github.com/mozilla/addons/blob/main/releases/2019/11/14.md)).
