## Before we start:
Note: there is an API change in addons-server that addons-frontend relies on.  It's a breaking change for both server and frontend so ideally they would finish deploying as close as possible to each other - the homepage will show errors while the tags don't match.

## Before we promote:

## After we're done:
run `./manage.py process_addons --task update_rating_aggregates` to back-fill rating counts in the database
