## Before we start:
Note: there is an API change in addons-server that addons-frontend relies on.  It's a breaking change for both server and frontend so ideally they would finish deploying as close as possible to each other - the homepage will show errors while the tags don't match.

## Before we promote:

## After we're done:
- run `./manage.py process_addons --task update_rating_aggregates` to back-fill rating counts in the database
- run `./manage.py process_addons --with-deleted --task hard_delete_legacy_versions` to hard-delete obsolete legacy versions we don't need
- Please deploy customs `1.20.0` to -prod


# Later:
- Once we know the tasks spawned from `hard_delete_legacy_versions` are done (took a couple hours on dev, lots of versions to get rid of), run `./manage.py process_addons --with-deleted --task hard_delete_extra_files` to hard-delete extra files we don't need on remaining versions
