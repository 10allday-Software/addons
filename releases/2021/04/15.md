## Before we start:
- Ensure there aren't any duplicate versions. The following SQL should return no results:
```sql
SELECT v.addon_id, v.version FROM versions v GROUP BY v.addon_id, v.version HAVING count(v.id) > 1
```
If it does return something, we need to figure out manually which versions to hard-delete (using `hard_delete_versions.delay(pks)` in a django shell) for the push to go through, as it will add a unique constraint that would fail if there are any duplicates.

## Before we promote:

## After we're done:

- Please deploy customs `2.1.0` to -prod
