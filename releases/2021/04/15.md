## Before we start:

```sql
SELECT v.addon_id, v.version FROM versions v GROUP BY v.addon_id, v.version HAVING count(v.id) > 1
```
If it does return something, we need to figure out manually which versions to hard-delete (using `hard_delete_versions.delay(pks)` in a django shell) for the push to go through, as it will add a unique constraint that would fail if there are any duplicates.
