## Before we push:

- Important: we need to ensure that the charset variables are set correctly, see: https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/15980. This is the config that we currently have for -dev and -stage, and we should make sure -prod has the same config:

```
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'char%';
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Variable_name            | Value                                     |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| character_set_client     | utf8mb4                                   |
| character_set_connection | utf8mb4                                   |
| character_set_database   | utf8mb4                                   |
| character_set_filesystem | binary                                    |
| character_set_results    | utf8mb4                                   |
| character_set_server     | utf8mb4                                   |
| character_set_system     | utf8                                      |
| character_sets_dir       | /rdsdbbin/mysql-5.7.26.R1/share/charsets/ |
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
```

It looks like only `character_set_server` needs to be updated, however when we did that for -stage, other values might have been updated to completely different values so it's important to re-run the `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'char%';` query to make sure all charset variables are configured correctly.

## Before we start:

* Setup Nginx Geo IP support on production.

## Before we promote:

## After we're done:

* Notify to the deploy channel we're ready to add the geo restriction entries.
* Delete the ES alias and index for "download counts", per
  * https://github.com/mozilla/addons-server/issues/15709
  * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1678172
