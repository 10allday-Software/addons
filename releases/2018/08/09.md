### Before we start:
* Make sure discovery editorial feed is set in the database - Ask Scott about it, there should be enough items with position and position_china set to build a feed for both regular and china editions. For reference, the admin is https://addons-internal.prod.mozaws.net/en-US/admin/models/discovery/discoveryitem/

### After we're done:

#### start:
