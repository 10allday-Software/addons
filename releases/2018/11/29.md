This week's push hero is @cgrebs

## Notable things shipping:

*

## Blockers:

* The patch for https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/issues/6958 had some problems so it will need a cherry pick

## Cherry-picks:

Link to the actual commits, NOT merge commits. The commits need to appear
in chronological order so that `git cherry-pick` will apply them correctly.
