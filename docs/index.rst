Add-ons
=======

This refers primarily to the work done by the Add-ons team at Mozilla.

If you are an Add-on Developer wanting to work on developing an Add-on for
Firefox, then you probably do not want to be looking at this documentation.
Instead checkout `MDN <https://developer.mozilla.org>`_
or `AMO <http://addons.mozilla.org>`_.
